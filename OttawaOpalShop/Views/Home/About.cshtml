                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>Founded in 1985, Ottawa Opal Shop has been a premier destination for opal enthusiasts and jewelry collectors for over three decades. What began as a small family business has grown into Ottawa's leading specialist in fine opal jewelry.</p>
                <p>Our founder, James Wilson, developed a passion for opals during his travels to Australia in the early 1980s. Captivated by the stone's unique play of colors, he established Ottawa Opal Shop with a mission to bring the finest opals to Canada.</p>
                <p>Today, the shop is run by the second generation of the Wilson family, who continue the tradition of excellence and expertise in opal jewelry.</p>
